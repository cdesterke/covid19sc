# Multi-omics investigation in lung with severe COVID-19 disease

### This repository is a bioinformatics support especially in R language to perform analyses on COVID19 lung datasets (single cell transcriptome and transcriptome)

## Synopsis
Millions of infections by the novel coronavirus 2019  (2019-nCoV or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2)) are already diagnose at worldwide level, with hundreds of thousands of deaths. The great majority of fatal disease forms have been recorded in adults older than 70 years. SARS-CoV2 is coronavirus which infects the host cells through an envelope spike (S) protein that mediates the binding and membrane fusion through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor (Lu, R. et al.,2020).SARS-CoV2 employs the transmembrane serine protease 2 of the host cell to prime the S protein and bind the ACE-2 receptor (Fu, Y.et al., 2020). At the lung level, ACE-2 receptors are mainly expressed on the alveolar epithelial type II cells (Zhang, H.,2020).
