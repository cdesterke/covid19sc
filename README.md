# Multi-omics investigation in lung with severe COVID-19 disease

## This repository is a bioinformatics support especially in R language to perform analyses on COVID19 lung datasets (single cell transcriptome and transcriptome)

### Synopsis
Millions of infections by the novel coronavirus 2019  (2019-nCoV or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2)) are already diagnose at worldwide level, with hundreds of thousands of deaths. The great majority of fatal disease forms have been recorded in adults older than 70 years. SARS-CoV2 is coronavirus which infects the host cells through an envelope spike (S) protein that mediates the binding and membrane fusion through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor (Lu,R. 2020).
